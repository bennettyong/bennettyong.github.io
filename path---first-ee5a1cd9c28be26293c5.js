This is first project working with Github Pages as well as Gatsby.js. </p>\n<p>I followed the <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/">tutorial from the Gatsby webpage</a>. This was my first exposure to static site generators and React.js so i did not know what to expect. </p>\n<p>After downloading Gatsby, i created a local file named blog to store this project <code>gatsby new blog</code> which creates a directory containing all the files for the site. There was no issues with the tutorial but i noticed that unlike a normal HTML <code>&#x3C;a href></code> tag, Gatsby uses the <code>gatsby-link</code> package and <code>&#x3C;Link></code> tags.</p>\n<p>Next up was to build an interactive counter on the site by creating a <code>Counter</code> class that extends <code>React.Component</code>. Just like in Java, the constructor of this class calls the super class constructor and adds an extra variable called state which keeps count(<code>this.state = { count: 0 }</code>).</p>\n<p>To make the buttons work, simple javascript was used to increment/decrement this state <code>onClick</code> while printing the <code>state</code> above.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"First Tutorial with Gatsby"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/first/"}}}});
